This plugin helps Wordpress bloggers to use SVG as the featured image which can be shared on Facebook or Twitter with the SVG preview image in the post. This plugin uses PHP ImageMagick to create thumbnails for your social shares, so please make sure this extension is available.
We recommend Safe SVG plugin to enable SVG/XML mime type on your Wordpress site.
